# FarmerGradingPlatform

Submission to Grow Asia Hackathon 2018

In Indonesia, oil palm cultivation has become important to rural livelihoods, particularly amongst smallholder farmers (“smallholders”). The focus of the Growth Asia Hackathon 2018 is independent smallholders, who have a significant role in the expansion of oil palm cultivation onto marginal lands or those not officially zoned for agriculture, and thus are a growing driver of deforestation and the resulting loss of biodiversity and increased greenhouse gas emissions. 

Designed a system to collect real-time data from farmers and provide them with geo-spatial data and weather forecast to improve productivity. Developed a dashboard as a platform for stakeholders to view farmers by their grading and identify opportunity for investments. Pitched to a panel of senior executives from Grow Asia, Unilever, Bayer, MUFG, East Ventures and industry experts in the audience.
